This work tackles the inefficiency and inaccuracy of traditional data poisoning detection methods. We model the task as a bi-level QUBO optimization problem and introduce a Quantum Weight Assignment Network (Q-WAN) to accelerate detection while maintaining performance. Experiments on GTSRB dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art results and a 20% speedup versus CUDA-based Meta-SIFT.
