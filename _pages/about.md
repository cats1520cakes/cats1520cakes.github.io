I am **Haoqi He **, a undergraduate majoring in **Cybersecurity** at **Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)**, graduating **June 2026**.  
My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence safety**, **Multimodal AI safety**, **quantum-inspired AI**, and **efficient deep learning**. I design algorithms that leverage *Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization* (QUBO) and emerging quantum-inspired method to improve robustness and scalability of modern machine-learning systems.

I would apply for Computer Science or AI-related **PhD programs (Fall 2026 intake)** in Hong Kong, Singapore, and related global hubs. My goal is to advance trustworthy AI and LLM safety or  quantum–inspired AI.
